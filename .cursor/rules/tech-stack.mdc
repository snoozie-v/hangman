- TanStack Table for data tables

### Form Management
- Tanstack Form for form handling

### Backend & Infrastructure
- Turso for database 
- Drizzle ORM 
- Vercel for hosting and deployment

### Testing
- Vitest for unit/integration tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for end-to-end tests

### Package Management
- pnpm for dependency management

## Integration Rules

### Next.js Integration

- Handle form submission with proper loading/error states

### Animation Integration
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Implement reduced motion alternatives
- Create consistent animation patterns
- Use Tailwind transitions for simple animations

### Testing Integration
- Test business logic with Vitest

### Database Integration
- Use Turso and Drizzle ORM for relational database needs
- Implement Row Level Security for all tables
- Create type-safe database clients
- Use Zod to validate database responses

## Technology Selection Guidelines

- Always prefer official solutions from the tech stack
- Consider bundle size impact for client-side libraries
- Evaluate license compatibility for all dependencies
- Prefer established, maintained libraries over newer alternatives
- Consider accessibility implications of all libraries
- Evaluate server-side compatibility for all additions
